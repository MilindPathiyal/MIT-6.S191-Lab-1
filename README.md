# Music Generation with RNNs

My first lab in 6.S191
MIT-6.S191-Lab-1: Intro to TensorFlow and Music Generation with RNNs  (In progress)

Part 1: Intro to TensorFlow
Learned the basics of computations in TensorFlow, the Keras API, and TensorFlow's new imperative execution style enabled by Eager.

Part 2: Music Generation with RNNs
Built a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation. 
Used a "character RNN" to predict the next character of sheet music in ABC notation. 
Finally, I sampled from this model to generate a brand new music file that has never been heard before!
